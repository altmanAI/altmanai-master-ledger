Thanks for your interest in improving the AltmanAI Master Ledger.

## Ground Rules
- No private personal data.
- Proof-of-Impact only: every change must reference a Registry ID or create a new one via the templates.
- Keep marketing and public-facing copy clear, human-friendly, and verifiable.

## Workflow
1. Open an issue (Bug, Feature, Ledger Entry, or Docs Update).
2. Create a branch and reference the issue/Registry ID.
3. Submit a PR with a short checklist:
   - [ ] PAIHI metadata present
   - [ ] Save-Receipt JSON attached in PR if adding files
   - [ ] Links/screenshots for verification when applicable

## Commit Message Style
`type(scope): short summary  — RegistryID`

Examples:
- `docs(press): add media boilerplate — AFG-PAIHI-2025-SECURE-0001-QR1`
- `ledger(core): add 2025-10-26 session mint — AFG-POI-2025-10-26-MINT-0001`
