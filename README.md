# AltmanAI — Master Ledger & Brand Core

**Humanity × AI, operationalized.**  
AltmanAI (by Altman Family Group, LLC) builds human‑centered AI and ships with receipts —
our Proof‑of‑AI‑Human‑Impact (PAIHI) Registry makes outcomes auditable.

## What’s in this repo
- `/ledger` — the public Master Ledger index (JSONL/CSV/Markdown) with select Registry entries.
- `/registry` — PAIHI standards, templates, and JSON schemas (Minting Badge v1.0, Save‑Receipt v1, PoC Tag v1.0).
- `/docs` — brand messaging, press kit, governance, and FAQs.
- `/data` — core brand facts for reuse in sites, press, and apps.
- `/legal` — placeholder drafts for Privacy/Terms (to be finalized).

> Signature process: **Human authorization → AI execution → Proof‑of‑Impact validation**

## Why this exists
Trust shouldn’t be a vibe; it should be inspectable. The Master Ledger centralizes what matters:
facts, timestamps, and verifiable artifacts.

## Products to watch
- **DailyPilot** — your personal AI copilot that simplifies the day.
- **PAIHI Portable Verifier v1** — verify artifacts quickly and portably.

## Get involved
- Open an issue with the type **“Ledger Entry”** to propose a new public entry.
- Include Save‑Receipt JSON and, where relevant, a Minting Badge snippet.
- Keep copy plain‑spoken and useful — this is for humans first.
