# FAQ

**What is the Master Ledger?**
A public‑facing index of key Proof‑of‑Impact entries and brand facts that the community can trust and verify.

**Is this a blockchain?**
No. We use cryptographic hashes and receipts; storage can be anywhere (GitHub, IPFS, cloud). The point is verifiability.

**Can I contribute?**
Yes, via PRs following the CONTRIBUTING guide. Marketing copy should be clear and cite Registry IDs when possible.
